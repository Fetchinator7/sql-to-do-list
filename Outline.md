## Requirements:
Create a front-end user experience.
Store in the database.
When a task is added refresh (call a function to get every item.)
Each task needs a delete or complete button.

Give each task a different CSS class based on if it's complete or not. (change to bootstrap later.)
Give each task a check mark to indicate it it's done or not.

Make a router and pool module so I can get a better idea of how they work.

## My stretch goals:
## Realistic:
Assign an optional "tag" parameter.
Give a "notes" field to add notes about a task.
Assign a "Priority" option for each task: None, !, !!, or, !!!
Assign a date/time a task should be completed.
Set a location for a task to be completed?

## Unsure how realistic these are in the time I have:
Allow a task to repeat automatically
Click on a category/attribute to toggle between sorting by that ASC or DESC
Play sound effects when a task is completed, deleted, etc.
Assign a category for a task.
Filter viewing options such as only showing !!! tasks.

## Setup:
npm init --yes
npm install express --save
npm install pg --save
