# Description

This is a simple to do list I created when we were just starting to use databases and still using jQuery so it seems really basic now, but at the time it was a challenge. This is mainly here to serve as a little time-capsule to where my skill level was at when writing this.

## Using it

Clone the project, create the database with the [Database Preset](database.sql), run `npm install` `npm start` and visit http://localhost:5000/ to view the app.
